# CanoeDB
When you need simple elegance that's gentle on the environment and glides as effortlessly across tangled data swamps as pristine lakes.

- Relational: each CSV file becomes a table with relationships to other tables
- In-memory: all reading is from memory, never from disk
- Disk persistence: writes are recorded to memory and disk
- Auto-dereferencing: references between tables are dereferenced automatically -- you don't need to worry about whether the columns you're joining are from the same table or from distinct tables related through a chain of inter-related tables.
